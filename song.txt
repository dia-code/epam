It washes over me
Grabs a hold of me
It digs in deep
And I can hardly breathe
The waves are crashing in
The tide has come to pull me back in
It's like the weight of it all
It comes from the chain


That I can't seem to break
And I can't seem to face
What I cannot escape
Erase, erase it all
Tear down the walls
